My goal: Map college course catalogs for any given across a dynamic tree diagram or force directed chart that maps out the relationships of a course's prerequisites, co-requisites, and misc requirements.

I love education but sometimes it can be a pain, especially when it comes to mapping out the courses that you want to take in college and making sense of your college transcript.
I graduated a semester late instead of a year early, this is me scratching my own itch.
